# The Degree Show 2014 wp theme
__For the ravensbourne 2014 show - http://www.ravensbourne.ac.uk/__

Soon to be made up of all sorts of cool stuff.

* Uses Bootstrap 3.0, see docs - http://getbootstrap.com/
* Based on Bones - http://themble.com/bones
* Uses LESS, see docs - http://lesscss.org/ . It's not scary, I promise. It is meant to make things easier!
* vanilla.html is an overview of all set styles on base html elements

## Set up notes
* Have your own wordpress set up and install this repositry as a theme.
* Make sure you have a LESS compiler if you are making style changes. I reccommend http://incident57.com/less/ or http://wearekiss.com/simpless . Do not change the css file directly.

## LESS quick intro
You can just code straight CSS into less files. The main difference is that you need to compile less files into a CSS file using a compiler. There are plenty of ways coding in LESS is more efficent, you can read about them on the docs here: http://lesscss.org/

With your Less compiler, make sure you are ONLY compiling the main style.less file and no other file - you should just be able to uncheck them. The main style.less file references all the other files. Set the 'css output file location' to the correct /css folder so the compiler does not compile the css into the same folder as the less files.

The less files should automatically compile when you save them. Try changing something, check the compiler log to check it goes through. The only exception may be if you are working with less files referenced in @media queries - mobile site stuff. In that case, you may have to save style.less to trigger the compiler.

Less is supposed to be helpful. I've set repetitive colours in the mixins.less file and other variables - you may recognise this kind of feature from javascript. Yell if you need help.

### Menu
Under Appearance / Menu create a menu called 'main', add menu items and set the theme location to be 'The Main Menu'.

### Homepage: featured posts
Create category 'featured', set some posts with that category.

### Homepage: Twitter feed
This theme is set up with kebo : http://wordpress.org/plugins/kebo-twitter-feed/
Follow their installation instructions up to #5, which is not required : http://wordpress.org/plugins/kebo-twitter-feed/installation/

To get the meta data (date posted) in the right place you have to edit the plugin files. Specifically, kebo-twitter-feed/views/list.php . Move the entire .kmeta div inbetween .ktext and .kfooter to get it inline with the reply/retweet etc buttons.

### Meet the team page
The Meet the team page is designed to be populated entirely through wordpress. When logged into the wordpress backend you should see 'Meet the team' on the left hand nav which will allow you to add people.

When adding a new team member, make sure you can see the following fields:
'Team' 'Featured Image' 'Custom Fields'
If you cannot you may need to toggle them on in the 'Screen Options' menu.

Fill as follows:
* Their name in the title field
* Their bio in the usual post field
* Set their Team in the 'team' field on the right hand side, like you would with post categories. It doesn't matter what you call the teams from a coding point of view.
* Set their icon through the 'featured image' section
* If they have an instagram account, put the full web address (usually http://instagram.com/username) in a custom field named 'instagram' (caps sensitive, no quotation marks)
* If they have an twitter handle, put the full web address ( usually https://twitter.com/username ) in a custom field named 'twitter' (caps sensitive, no quotation marks)
* If they have an linkedin account, put the full public web address ( generated by linkedin ) in a custom field named 'linkedin' (caps sensitive, no quotation marks)

I am happy to set up example people if necessary but it should be straight foward.

## Introduction to Bones
Bones http://themble.com/bones is a simple wordpress theme designed to be changed by developers. Hopefully it will have already catered for most of our requirements, so be sure to look through the files thoroughly as there are a lot of good functions.

library/bones.php - register stylesheets and scripts are here, functionality to handle thumbnails, register menus, ability to add 'related posts' to a page (organised by post tag), pagination handling.

Bones theme also features custom post setup which can be treated as entirely different to normal posts.
