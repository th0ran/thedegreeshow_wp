## Introduction to Bones
Bones http://themble.com/bones is a simple wordpress theme designed to be changed by developers. Hopefully it will have already catered for most of our requirements, so be sure to look through the files thoroughly as there are a lot of good functions.

library/bones.php - register stylesheets and scripts are here, functionality to handle thumbnails, register menus, ability to add 'related posts' to a page (organised by post tag), pagination handling.

Bones theme also features custom post setup which can be treated as entirely different to normal posts.
